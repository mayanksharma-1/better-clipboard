# Better Clipboard: Enhancing Chrome's Clipboard Functionality

**Background**: The native Chrome clipboard offers limited functionality, hindering efficient information flow. Existing extensions often lack key features or are poorly designed, leading to a fragmented user experience.

**Objectives**: This project proposes "Better Clipboard", a Chrome extension addressing these shortcomings by:
• Storing a history: Access and reuse recently copied/cut items without re- copying.
• Pinning snippets: Save specific snippets for future reference.
• Seamless integration: Integrate seamlessly with existing Chrome
workflows.

**Significance** : Better Clipboard addresses a common pain point by offering a more powerful and efficient way to manage the clipboard. This project contributes to the Chrome ecosystem by enhancing user productivity and simplifying information management.
